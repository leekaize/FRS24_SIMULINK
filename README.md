# Standing Fan Virtual Hardware Model
This project simulates a standing fan using MATLAB/Simulink for predictive maintenance research.

## Structure
- `models/`: Contains Simulink model files
- `scripts/`: Contains MATLAB scripts
- `data/`: Stores generated simulation data
- `results/`: Stores output plots and figures

## Usage
1. Ensure MATLAB and required toolboxes are installed.
2. At project root folder, run `main.m` script to execute the entire simulation process (with command `run('scripts/main.m')`).
